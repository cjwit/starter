## K-Pop: The Diasporic Dancing Body

### A talk by Chuyun Oh

Facilitated by global social media, K-pop becomes a platform for exploring alternative identities among global youth. This keynote speech addresses the diasporic imagery of "home" in K-pop fandom based on Dr. Oh's ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with K-pop cover dance groups since 2015. By adapting K-pop choreography, lyric, fashion, makeup, and fandom culture, they migrate K-pop dance to their space and construct nostalgic, hybridized, alternative cultural identities. They challenge the localized notion of racialized and gendered norms, build a sense of community, and perform multiple personae while experiencing a process of becoming with alter egos. Their cultural adaption and embodiment of K-pop extends and traverses the location of cultural identity within fixed geography.
