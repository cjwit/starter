## Feminista Hip Hop/Futurismo Feminista: Sumak Kawsai/Buen Vivir/Living Right in the Americas

### A Talk by Michelle Habell-Pallán

What might a feminista futurism sound like? By focusing on an encuentro & dialogue called “Feminista Hip Hop/Futurismo Feminista” that took place in Quito, Ecuador in Summer 2017, this paper accounts for current Andean feminista examples of collective hip hop music-based mobilizations that provide alternative practices of “Sumak Kawsai/Buen Vivir/The Good Life.” It discusses ways that music and digital media bring about new ways of collective being, while building participatory communities and music within and beyond national borders. This paper understands music production and listening as sites of engagement that can produce and/or challenge social structures of equity. As a method, it pushes on narrative frameworks that naturalize the absence of women of color and Chicanx and Latin Americanx musical movements in music scholarship, and tracks music practices and politics that move us into the good life.
